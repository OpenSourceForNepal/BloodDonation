# Blood Donation

This is one of a few **Open Source** projects to help victims of **Earthquake Nepal 2015**. We are trying to build these projects in collaboration with different Doctors and Hospitals in Nepal and all over the world. Please open issues, contribute and open pull requests. Your small effort could save millions of lives.

What is this all about?
---
As you may already know Nepal is going through a lot right now. More than 6500+ death toll, countless people homeless, billions of dollars in property destruction. We all have been donating and supporting however we can.

Now, we are inviting all Developers, Designers and Concerned Individuals to help Rebuild Nepal with Open Source Projects and Software. Please [SIGN UP](http://opensourcefornepal.github.io) and join our slack channel where we will communicate and collaborate on different ideas and ways we can help.

This project is mainly focusing on increasing blood donation, inviting and encouraging people in Nepal to donate blood.
